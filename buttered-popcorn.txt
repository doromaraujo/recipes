Ingredients:
 - 3 cups of corn kernels for popcorn
 - 2 tablespoons of salted butter
 - 2 teaspoons of salt

Directions:

 1. Add the butter to a popper and let it melt. Best to use low heat in order 
    to not darken the melted butter.

 2. Add the corn kernels and salt. Use medium to high heat. Don't forget to 
    cover the popper!

 3. Crank the popper's handle vigorously once the first kernels start popping.

 4. If it gets too hard to keep on cranking, it's because your popper is full.
    Carefully remove the popper's cover and place the excess popcorn in a
    recipient. KEEP CRANKING!

 5. Once the time between popping sounds increase over 3 seconds, lower the 
    heat until there is no more sound - it means all the kernels are DEAD.

 6. Quickly place the remaining popcorn in the recipient before it gets burnt
    and ends up sticking to the bottom of your popper - no one likes to scrub
    those marks clean!
